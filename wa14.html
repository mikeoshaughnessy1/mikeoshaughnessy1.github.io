	<p>For the first assignment I analyzed the tv show Chernobyl so I will briefly chat about the show and how to convey information about that show to different groups of people.  <p>



<p>First off, If I were presenting to a group of data scientists both Jupyter notebooks and a reveal JS visualization would be the best way to present my information because this group of peoples would most likely be attracted to the hard facts and the information surrounding the claims that I was making. I think reveal JS can be a beneficial tool to present information to all audiences.<p>

<p>I think that for tv audiences reveal js and bootstrap would be sme of the most effective ways to present information. I think that this group of people are mostly focused on visual pleasure and how things look as a whole, and I think bootstrap and reveal js would be the best for this.<p> 

<p>If I was presenting information for an environmentalist I would most likely use reveal js as well as vega because I am most comfortable with reveal js but I imagine they would want to see a more in depth account of the facts surrounding the topic. I think depending on this groups line of environmentalism, they could want to see a juptyer notebook as well.  <p>
